# Jigsaw Tech Test - Ephie Oyedoh 

## How it went ?

- I seemed to do okay with the category route but struggled with the cashflow route. 
- I spent a lot of time mainly trying to understand everything that I was doing. 
- I wish I had a little more time to keep working on the server but understanding every step took a little too much time.
- I'v e never used mocha and chai and wasn't sure about how to integrate tape alongside chai but I hope to look more into it. 


## What's completed ?
- the category route works and sends back calculated data fetched from the given route. 
- the cashflow route renders back a list of ordered dates but I struggled to filter the return data by dates whithout writing repeated code. 

### Overall I enjoyed the opportunity to try out the tech test it was a challenge, but it was a challenge I enjoyed.
